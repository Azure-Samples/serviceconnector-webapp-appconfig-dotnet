## Overview
[Service Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-connector/) is an Azure-managed service that helps developers easily connect compute service to target backing services. This service configures the network settings and connection information (for example, generating environment variables) between compute service and target backing service. Developers just use preferred SDK or library that consumes the connection information to do data plane operations against target backing service.

Service Connector supports Azure WebApp, Azure Spring Cloud as source of connection, and over [10+ Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-connector/overview#what-services-are-supported-in-service-connector) as target, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Storage, Keyvault, ServiceBus, SignalR etc.

This repository contains sample projects to connect Azure WebApp to App Configuration via ServiceConnector. 

## Sample list
Below table shows the list of samples in this repository. All authentication types between Azure WebApp and App Configuration are covered.
